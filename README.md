Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aesy/Similitude/issues) to report bugs or make feature requests.
There are a lot of functions left to be included for the library to feel complete. This is because I only aim to implement the functions I personally need, but I will gladly accept pull requests! It may be a good idea (as always) to create an issue to discuss it first though! Maybe you want to contribute but don't know how? Check the list below for some inspiration!
